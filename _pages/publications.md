Observations of the asteroids have been performed as long as it has been feasible by the available observational equipment. Recorded data, going back to 18th century, allowed a classification of these celestial objects’ hazardous status. Unfortunately, previous studies used methods that ignore subject dependency in Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA) data. This study aims to perform hazard classification of asteroids by proposing various
statistical and machine learning methods on NEA data to overcome these shortcomings. We analyze data from 751 asteroids observed at irregular time intervals through the NASA. We compare algorithms suitable for longitudinal data structure, such as the Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM), marginal model, GLMM-Tree, Historical Random Forest, GPBoost, and Spline. To the best of our knowledge and based on a comprehensive review of the existing literature, our study stands as the pioneering in the utilization of these advanced methodologies for the in-depth analysis of Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) data. According to the findings, the accuracies of the models range from 0.89 to 0.99. The GPBoost model has the highest performance, while the marginal model has the poorest one.

The importance of predicting drought, a significant environmental and socio-economic challenge, cannot be overstated. This research undertakes an extensive examination of drought phenomena, integrating two intricate datasets that detail weather and soil conditions across various counties in the United States (U.S.). We analyze data across the U.S. from 2000 to 2020, comparing algorithms that account for spatio-temporal structures. Specifically, we evaluate Gradient Boosting Machines techniques such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Additionally, we develop deep learning (DL) models, including long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Transformer architectures. Hybrid models, such as CNN–LSTM and Attention-LSTM, are also explored. For ensemble methods, we implement stacking and voting classifiers to enhance robustness and performance. These models were chosen as they effectively capture spatio-temporal structures in the data, making them particularly suitable for drought prediction. We also perform clustering to divide the data into homogeneous regions and analyze feature importance using both Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values and impurity-based methods derived from tree-based models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), in order to identify the most predictive features of drought scores within each region. To the best of our knowledge and based on a comprehensive review of existing literature, our study is pioneering in utilizing these advanced methodologies for an in-depth analysis of drought score data in the U.S. Our findings indicate model accuracies ranging from 0.5938 to 0.9783, with the highest performance achieved by the Attention-LSTM Hybrid Model and the lowest by XGBoost, although this increased accuracy comes at the cost of significantly longer computation time for DL models.

Air pollution poses severe threats to global public health and environmental sustainability, with complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Traditional air quality models face limitations in capturing longitudinal dependencies and managing computational costs at scale. To address these challenges, we propose the Hybrid Mixed-Effect Diffusion (H-MED) model, a novel framework integrating mixed-effects regression, Gaussian-Process Regression (GPR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and diffusion-based learning for enhanced predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification. Applied to a comprehensive longitudinal dataset spanning 61 countries (2013–2023), H-MED demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest prediction errors (MAE:0.1423, RMSE:0.1925), while maintaining computational efficiency (5.69 s). The model significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches including advanced spatiotemporal models such as HITS, DCRNN, ST-GCN, and DeepAR by 15%–20% across all metrics. By incorporating country-level random effects and providing SHAP-based feature attribution, H-MED delivers interpretable, high-resolution forecasts that capture regional pollution heterogeneity and enable targeted policy interventions, a critical advantage over black-box deep learning models that lack explainability for environmental decision-making.
