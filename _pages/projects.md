## Featured Research Projects


### Spatial/temporal variations of drought indices using remote sensing, ground observations to predict crop yield with machine learning algorithms in Central Anatolia, Turkiye.

Conducted a research project on agricultural drought and winter wheat yield prediction in Central Anatolia using remote sensing and machine learning. Developed a custom drought index (GLNM) and applied time series analysis on satellite-derived climate and vegetation indicators from 2007 to 2021. Integrated multi-source data including land surface, air, and soil temperatures, along with precipitation and drought indices for model development.

### Multilingual Metaphor Analysis and Generation with RSA and Neural Models

This project explores metaphor analysis and generation by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Rational Speech Act (RSA) models to improve metaphor comprehension. By combining RSA’s recursive reasoning with neural networks (LSTM, BERT), the study aims to capture pragmatic inference and speaker-listener interactions, addressing the complexities of metaphor interpretation. The project extends beyond English to include Turkish metaphors, testing the adaptability of LLMs such as BERTurk in multilingual contexts. Besides, it investigates whether RSA-guided reasoning enhances the metaphor generation capabilities of LLMs, ensuring outputs are both contextually appropriate and novel.

### Brain Tumor Segmentation with U-Net

Focused on brain tumor segmentation using deep learning techniques applied to MRI scans. The aim is to develop an optimized model that enhances segmentation accuracy for different tumor regions, aiding in precise diagnosis and treatment planning. Advanced U-Net architectures is implemented such as deep supervision, attention mechanisms, and residual connections. Extensive experimentation with training schedules, loss functions, and post-processing strategies was conducted to maximize performance.

### Effective Gravitational Wave Detection Using Anomaly Detection and Hybrid & Ensemble Deep Learning Algorithms

This study enhances gravitational wave detection by integrating anomaly detection with ensemble and hybrid learning techniques. Methods like Isolation-Forest and Local-Outlier-Factor identify rare events, which are then classified into signals and noise to focus on significant deviations. To address performance challenges with large data, deep learning models and hybrid architectures (CNN-LSTM, LSTM-Attention) capture complex temporal patterns. Additionally, ensemble methods (stacking, voting) applied to machine learning models) improve predictive accuracy.
