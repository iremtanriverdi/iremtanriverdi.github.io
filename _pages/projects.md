## Featured Research Projects

### **Multilingual Metaphor Analysis and Generation with RSA and Neural Models** *(Paper under Review)*
Explores metaphor analysis and generation by integrating **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with **Rational Speech Act (RSA) models**. The study evaluates recursive reasoning in neural models like **LSTM and BERT**, focusing on **Turkish and English metaphors**.

### **Feature Visualization of Deep Neural Networks**
Comparative analysis of **ResNet18** and **Vision Transformers (ViT)** by analyzing feature maps with different training configurations and augmentation techniques.

### **Brain Tumor Segmentation with U-Net**
Optimized **U-Net architectures** with **deep supervision, attention mechanisms, and residual connections** for **MRI-based brain tumor segmentation**.
