### Personal Profile

I am a Teaching Assistant and PhD candidate in Statistics at Middle East Technical University (METU). My research spans mathematical statistics, machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, with a strong focus on longitudinal data analysis, ensemble learning, and hybrid deep learning models.

My MSc research focused on developing machine learning models for correlated (longitudinal) data. Currently, my PhD focus is on advanced probability theory and the development of ensemble and hybrid deep learning models that push the boundaries of artificial intelligence. I combine statistical foundations with machine learning research, aiming to design robust, interpretable AI systems — often exploring how statistical structure and hybrid architectures can improve generalization and reasoning ability in modern models.
